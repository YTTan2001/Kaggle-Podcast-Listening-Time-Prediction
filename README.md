## Dataset Description
The dataset for kaggle competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Podcast Listening Time Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

2. test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the Listening_Time_minutes for each row
